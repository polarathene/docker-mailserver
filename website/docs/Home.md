**Welcome to the extended documentation for docker-mailserver!**

Please first have a look at the [README.md](https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/blob/master/README.md) to setup and configure this server.  
This wiki provides you with advanced configuration, detailed examples, hintsâ€¦ (see navigation on the right side).

**To get you started:**

- A `setup.sh` script is supplied with this project, which supports you in configuring and administrating your server.
  - Information on how to get it & how to use it is available [in the dedicated page](https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/wiki/Setup-docker-mailserver-using-the-script-setup.sh).
  - Be aware that advanced tasks may still require tweaking env vars, reading through documentation and sometimes inspecting your running container for debug. Feel free to ask for help by [creating an issue](https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/issues) with all relevant information.
- A list of all configuration options is provided in the [README.md](https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/blob/master/README.md). That is a good starting point to understand what this image is capable of.
- A list of all optional and automatically created configuration files and directories is available [in the dedicated page](https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/wiki/List-of-optional-config-files-&-directories).
- See the [FAQ](https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/wiki/FAQ-and-Tips) for some more tips!
