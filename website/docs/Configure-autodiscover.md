Configuring clients just with autodiscover:

* using [jsmitsnl/docker-email-autodiscover](https://hub.docker.com/r/jsmitsnl/docker-email-autodiscover/)
* using [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/) for ssl (recommended)

### Docker Email Autodiscover

With docker email auto discover you can accounts find the correct email settings by just filling their email address. Client will search for auto discover settings and prefill almost everything.

There is a full [README](https://hub.docker.com/r/jsmitsnl/docker-email-autodiscover/) available on the docker repo to set it up.
